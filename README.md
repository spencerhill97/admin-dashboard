# Admin Dashboard

This project is an admin dashboard. The project is responsive for desktop sizes and I think would be a great starting point for my other projects if I need an admin dashboard. This project was admittedly a challenge because I was not that used to CSS grid. I learned a lot and I am much more confident with the grid system. I understand the benefits and it has felt much more natural to implement in my current projects!
